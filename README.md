# Autonomous RC Car MCP Server

This is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides autonomous navigation capabilities for an RC car. The system integrates with a Flask server running on a QNX Pi to control physical motors and camera hardware.

## üöó System Overview

The autonomous RC car system consists of:

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`) - Provides LLM interface for autonomous navigation
2. **Flask Server** (`flask_motor_control.py`) - Controls physical hardware on QNX Pi
3. **Camera System** - Takes photos and analyzes them with AI
4. **Motor Control** - Controls forward, backward, left, and right movements

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### Movement Tools

#### `move_forward(duration: float = 0.3)`

- **Purpose**: Move the RC car forward
- **Duration**: 0.1-1.0 seconds (default: 0.3s)
- **Use Cases**: Approaching targets, moving toward objectives
- **Precision**: Shorter durations (0.2-0.4s) for fine control

#### `move_backward(duration: float = 0.3)`

- **Purpose**: Move the RC car backward
- **Duration**: 0.1-1.0 seconds (default: 0.3s)
- **Use Cases**: Backing away from obstacles, repositioning
- **Safety**: Useful for avoiding collisions

#### `turn_left(duration: float = 0.3)`

- **Purpose**: Turn the RC car left (rotate in place)
- **Duration**: 0.1-1.0 seconds (default: 0.3s)
- **Use Cases**: Changing direction, aligning with targets
- **Control**: Shorter durations for fine adjustments

#### `turn_right(duration: float = 0.3)`

- **Purpose**: Turn the RC car right (rotate in place)
- **Duration**: 0.1-1.0 seconds (default: 0.3s)
- **Use Cases**: Changing direction, aligning with targets
- **Control**: Shorter durations for fine adjustments

#### `stop_car()`

- **Purpose**: Immediately stop all movement
- **Use Cases**: Safety, pausing movement, reassessing situation
- **Response**: Instant halt of all motors

### Sensing Tools

#### `take_photo_and_analyze(goal_description: str)`

- **Purpose**: Take a photo and analyze it for navigation
- **Input**: Description of what the car is trying to find
- **Output**: AI analysis with recommended next actions
- **Analysis Codes**:
  - `GOAL_ACHIEVED`: Target is centered and reached
  - `MOVE_LEFT`: Target visible on left side
  - `MOVE_RIGHT`: Target visible on right side
  - `MOVE_FORWARD`: Target visible but too far
  - `MOVE_BACKWARD`: Target too close
  - `TURN_LEFT`: Target not visible, search left
  - `TURN_RIGHT`: Target not visible, search right
  - `NOT_FOUND`: Target completely absent

### System Tools

#### `get_car_status()`

- **Purpose**: Get system health and status information
- **Returns**: Connection status, available tools, configuration
- **Use Cases**: Debugging, monitoring system health

## üß† Autonomous Navigation Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Continuous Assessment**: Always take photos to understand current position
2. **Incremental Movement**: Use short, controlled movements (0.2-0.4s)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Analyze each photo to determine next action
4. **Goal-Oriented**: Keep the objective in mind with every decision
5. **Safety First**: Avoid obstacles and use conservative movements

### Navigation Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**: Take photo to understand current situation
2. **Analysis**: AI analyzes photo based on goal description
3. **Decision**: Choose appropriate movement based on analysis
4. **Execution**: Execute movement with appropriate duration
5. **Reassessment**: Take new photo and repeat process
6. **Goal Achievement**: Continue until target is reached

### Movement Guidelines

- **Forward**: Use for approaching targets or moving toward objectives
- **Backward**: Use for backing away from obstacles or repositioning
- **Left/Right Turns**: Use for changing direction or aligning with targets
- **Fine Adjustments**: Use 0.2-0.3s durations for precise positioning
- **Search Patterns**: Use systematic turns when target is not visible

## üîß Configuration

### Network Configuration

```python
BASE_URL = "http://10.33.35.1:5000"  # Flask server on QNX Pi
LAPTOP_IP = "10.33.49.88"  # Laptop IP for processing
LAPTOP_PORT = 8000  # Laptop port for processing
```

### Movement Parameters

```python
DEFAULT_DURATION = 0.3  # Default movement duration
MAX_DURATION = 1.0      # Maximum safe duration
MIN_DURATION = 0.1      # Minimum duration
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Movement

```python
# Move forward for 0.3 seconds
move_forward(duration=0.3)

# Turn left for 0.2 seconds (fine adjustment)
turn_left(duration=0.2)

# Stop all movement
stop_car()
```

### Autonomous Navigation

```python
# Take photo and analyze for goal
result = take_photo_and_analyze("Find a red ball on the ground")

# Based on analysis, execute appropriate movement
if "MOVE_LEFT" in result["analysis_result"]:
    turn_left(duration=0.2)
elif "MOVE_FORWARD" in result["analysis_result"]:
    move_forward(duration=0.3)
```

### Complete Navigation Loop

```python
goal = "Find a keychain object on the ground"

# Initial assessment
photo_result = take_photo_and_analyze(goal)

# Navigation loop
while "GOAL_ACHIEVED" not in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
    # Execute movement based on analysis
    if "MOVE_LEFT" in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
        turn_left(duration=0.2)
    elif "MOVE_RIGHT" in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
        turn_right(duration=0.2)
    elif "MOVE_FORWARD" in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
        move_forward(duration=0.3)
    elif "TURN_LEFT" in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
        turn_left(duration=0.4)
    elif "TURN_RIGHT" in photo_result["analysis_result"]:
        turn_right(duration=0.4)

    # Reassess
    photo_result = take_photo_and_analyze(goal)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_mcp_server.py
```

### Individual Tests

- Flask server connection
- Movement endpoints
- Photo capture and analysis
- Movement sequences
- Duration control
- Autonomous navigation simulation

## üîí Safety Considerations

1. **Duration Limits**: Never use durations longer than 1.0 seconds
2. **Movement Validation**: All durations are clamped to safe ranges
3. **Error Handling**: All requests include timeout and error handling
4. **Stop Function**: Always available for emergency stopping
5. **Conservative Movements**: Default to shorter durations for safety

## üìã System Requirements

### Hardware

- QNX Pi with motor control hardware
- Camera system for photo capture
- Network connectivity between components

### Software

- Python 3.7+
- FastMCP library
- Requests library
- Flask server running on QNX Pi

### Network

- Flask server accessible at `http://10.33.35.1:5000`
- Laptop processing available at `10.33.49.88:8000`

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Frequent Photos**: Take photos often to maintain situational awareness
2. **Short Movements**: Use 0.2-0.4s durations for precise control
3. **Systematic Search**: Use systematic patterns when target is not visible
4. **Goal Focus**: Always keep the objective in mind
5. **Safety First**: Prioritize safety over speed
6. **Error Recovery**: Handle errors gracefully and retry when appropriate

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**: Check network connectivity to Flask server
2. **Photo Failures**: Verify camera system is working
3. **Movement Issues**: Check motor connections and power
4. **Analysis Errors**: Verify AI processing system is available

stop_car()

# Test photo system
photo_result = take_photo_and_analyze("Test goal")
```
