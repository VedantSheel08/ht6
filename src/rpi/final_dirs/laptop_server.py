def process_image_with_gemini(image_file, goal_description):
    """
    Process the received image with Gemini API based on the goal description.
    """

    prompt = f"""
You are an image analysis function for a motor car with a camera. Your goal: "{goal_description}"

Analyze the image and respond with:
- The best action code (see below) on the first line.
- A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) on the next line, including any uncertainty or nuance.

Action codes (choose one):
1. GOAL_ACHIEVED: Target is clearly visible and centered (car has reached goal).
2. MOVE_LEFT: Target is visible on the left 25% of the frame. Note if unsure how much to move or risk of overshoot.
3. MOVE_RIGHT: Target is visible on the right 25%. Note any uncertainty.
4. MOVE_FORWARD: Target is visible but too far away. Mention if distance is unclear.
5. MOVE_BACKWARD: Target is visible but too close.
6. TURN_RIGHT: Target not visible; recommend rotating right to search.
7. TURN_LEFT: Target not visible; recommend rotating left to search.
8. NOT_FOUND: Target is completely absent from the view.

Instructions:
- Be specific about the target's position and any uncertainty about movement or car accuracy.
- If the target is partially visible or ambiguous, explain your reasoning and suggest the best movement.
- Mention if a movement might overshoot or if fine adjustment is needed.
- Do NOT use vague codes like "REORIENT" or "ADJUST POSITION"â€”pick from the list above.
- If reorientation is needed, specify TURN_LEFT or TURN_RIGHT and why.

Keep your response concise and focused on helping the car center and approach the target safely.
